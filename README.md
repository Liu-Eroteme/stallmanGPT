# StallmanGPT

StallmanGPT is a Linux command generator and assistant using OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo. It generates Linux commands based on user input and provides explanations for the generated commands. Users can choose to execute the generated command if it meets their requirements.

The future plan for this is pretty simple: Develop StallmanGPT into an autonomous agent running contnuously, taking care of your system and helping you out where needed - i've got my roadmap on a whiteboard but have other work to finish first. Want this sooner? Gimme money (this is a joke but seriously, im independent and kinda broke) but no fr, whats holding me back the most is: my personal openAI API account no has GPT4 API access...
(there's ways but not worth for this) and after comparing the linux skills... no way im building and testing on GPT3.5

Someone make it so org-1nO0CK24y9gbenTfsjKfYvCK gets GPT4 access and I'll put a week straight into this :3 

And it's needed - this code? barely an MVP. The prompts? Crap. 

## Installation

Install StallmanGPT using pip:

```bash
pip install stallmangpt
```

You will also need an API key for OpenAI. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable with your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## Usage

To use StallmanGPT, run the following command with your desired text as an argument:

```bash
stallmangpt "your desired text"
```

For example:

```bash
stallmangpt "find all .md files and list them"
```

StallmanGPT will generate a Linux command that accomplishes the requested task, provide an explanation of the command, and prompt you to execute the command or not.

## Features

* Generates Linux commands based on user input.
* Provides explanations for the generated commands.
* Allows users to choose whether to execute the generated command or not.
* Implements error handling for OpenAI API usage limits and confidence rating parsing.
* Limits the number of user-initiated retries to 3.

## to do

So much, give the ai info about the os, better prompts, better model choices, UX, .. maybe some flags for stuff like using gpt4 if it's available etc
Oh and fix this readme, it kinda sucks
TBH, idk if i have the energy to actually build this out but hey, we'll see and now it's out there so
